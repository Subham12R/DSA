# 🧠 DSA Practice Repository

This repository contains my personal collection of **Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA)** problems that I solve and document as part of my ongoing practice and learning journey.
It includes problems from various sources such as **NeetCode 150**, **Striver’s A2Z DSA Sheet**, and additional coding challenges I practice regularly.

## 🚀 About This Repository

The goal of this repo is to:

* Build a **strong foundation in DSA** through consistent problem-solving.
* Practice **optimized coding approaches** and learn **patterns**.
* Maintain a **trackable record** of solved problems and progress.
* Prepare for **technical interviews** and competitive programming.

## 🧰 Tech & Setup

All problems are solved using **C++** (and occasionally **Python/JavaScript**).
Each file includes:

* Problem link
* Approach explanation
* Time & space complexity
* Code implementation

---

## 🌱 Goals

* Solve **at least 5 DSA problems per week**
* Focus on **pattern recognition** over memorization
* Track and document **optimized solutions**

---

## 🤝 Contributing

While this is a personal repo, feel free to:

* Suggest optimized solutions
* Open pull requests with better approaches
* Share additional problem lists or resources

---

## ⭐ Acknowledgments

Thanks to:

* **NeetCode** for structured problem sets
* **Striver (Raj Vikramaditya)** for the A2Z roadmap
* **Open-source DSA communities** that make learning collaborative and fun

Would you like me to **add GitHub-style badges** (like “Language”, “Repo Size”, “Last Commit”, etc.) or **progress bars** for NeetCode and Striver sections? It would make your README look even more professional.
